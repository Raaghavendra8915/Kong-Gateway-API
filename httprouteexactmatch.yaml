HTTPRouteMatch
Letâ€™s explore the criteria that can be utilized for matching requests.

HTTPPathMatch
Similar to using Ingress, we can use annotations on HTTPRoute to enhance routing capability.

The first criteria is to match requests path. As we can see from below examples, path supports Exact, PathPrefix and RegularExpression. This is similar to the Ingress Path types except for the Regex one.

Exact

apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: nginx-route
  namespace: nginx
  annotations:
    konghq.com/strip-path: 'true'
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: Gateway
      name: kong-gw-demo
      namespace: kong
  rules:
    - matches:
      - path:
          type: Exact
          value: /nginx
      backendRefs:
      - name: nginx-svc
        kind: Service
        port: 80
